# RECIPE WEBSITE
[TERMINAL AND GITHUB help](https://github.com/hello-world-tech-studios/terminal-and-github-help)

#### Your mission is create a webpage for your favorite recipe.
1. Find a recipe you would like to use.
2. Navigate to the `recipe.html` file in sublime.

# THE CODE
Your recipe page must include the following:

* A heading with the name of the dish.
* A paragraph explaining some fun facts about the dish.
* A picture of the final product. Or many pictures if you'd like!
    - Remember! Find the image you want on the internet. Then, right click and select "Copy Image Link Address" to get the image src. 
    - If you forget how to make an image tag...google it!
* An unordered list of ingredients.
* An ordered list of directions.

#### EXTENSION
* Links to 3 other suggested recipes. (HINT: Look [here](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp) to see how to put a link in your code )

* A table of nutritional facts (You can make these up if you would like to!). Figure out how to make a table by googling something like "how to make a table with HTML"

>  *Confused by the nutritional facts? Look at the [nutritional-facts](https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/italian-sausage-lasagna/2601a67c-438d-407a-b163-2f57ede06cb9) on this recipe.*
