# RECIPE WEBSITE
[TERMINAL AND GITHUB help](https://github.com/hw-studio-fall17/terminal-github-commands-help)

#### Your mission is create a webpage for your favorite recipe.
1. Find a recipe you would like to use.
2. Navigate to the `recipe.html` file in sublime.

# THE CODE
Your recipe page must include the following:

* A heading with the name of the dish.
* A paragraph explaining some fun facts about the dish.
* A picture of the final product. Or many pictures if you'd like!
    - Remember! Find the image you want on the internet. Then, right click and select "Copy Image Link Address" to get the image src. 
    - If you forget how to make an image tag...google it!
* An unordered list of ingredients.
* An ordered list of directions.

#### EXTENSION
* Links to 3 other suggested recipes. (HINT: Look [here](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp) to see how to put a link in your code )

* A table of nutritional facts (You can make these up if you would like to!). Figure out how to make a table by googling something like "how to make a table with HTML"

>  *Confused by the nutritional facts? Look at the [nutritional-facts](https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/italian-sausage-lasagna/2601a67c-438d-407a-b163-2f57ede06cb9) on this recipe.* 


## Troubleshooting checklist 
##### Please go through this checklist before asking for help!
1. Think through your problem and explain quietly it to your imaginary friend.
2. Did you save your code?
3. Do you have all of your code inside of the body element properly indented?
     ``` HTML
        <body>
          your code goes here.
        </body> ```
4. Do all of your HTML elements have an opening tag and a closing tag? (Except for `<img>` !)
5. Did you refresh your Chrome webpage?
6. Still stuck? Ask an instructor for help!
